# Looping Arrays - The for-of loop

- This is how we can use the new for-of loop in JS.

```js
const eve = {
  name: "Eve",
  dob: "1/1/1990",
  birthPlace: "New York",
  job: "Teacher",
  hobbies: ["rock climbing", "pottery"],
  friends: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dave", "Felicia"],
};

// Suppose we want to iterate over the friends property of eve
// We can do it without having to use a counter and incrementing it
// One important point is that in case of the for-of loop, the 'continue' and the 'break' keywords will work
// We will look at some other ways of looping in an array in which they won't. So it is an imp distinction to make
for (const friend of eve.friends) {
  console.log(`${friend}`); // Prints the list of friends
}
// Note that in the above example, we cannot access the index that we are in the array currently
// We can access the current index as well - like this:
for (const friend of eve.friends.entries()) {
  console.log(friend);
}
// Prints:
/*
[0, "Alice"]
[1, "Bob"]
[2, "Charlie"]
and so on... The point being that the index of the element is printed along with the element as an array with two elements
*/

// So you can access the element along with the index using:
// Note here how we are using the destructuring operator
for (const [idx, elm] of eve.friends.entries()) {
  console.log(`Friend ${idx}: ${elm}`);
}
// Prints:
/*
Friend 0: Alice
Friend 1: Bob
Friend 2: Charlie
and so on...
*/
```
