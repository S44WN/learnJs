# Closures

# - Refer Udemy Lecture here.

```js
// Consider the following function that returns a function
const secureBooking = function () {
  let numOfPassengers = 0;
  return function () {
    numOfPassengers++;
    console.log(`${numOfPassengers} number of passengers.`);
  };
};

// Now let us call this function:
const booker = secureBooking();

// And then we call booker. And then this happens:
booker(); // Prints: 1 number of passengers.
booker(); // Prints: 2 number of passengers.
booker(); // Prints: 3 number of passengers.

// So the question is:
// how can the booker function, that is defined in the global scope, access the numOfPassengers variable defined in the child scope
// of the secureBooking function? Not only access, but also store and then change the values each time it is called.
// Also, numOfPassengers is defined as a local variable in the secureBooking function.
// The normal understanding is that once a function finishes its execution, the local variables to the function can no longer be accessed.
// But in this case we can access and change the values of the variable -
// even after the function secureBooking has returned - through the booker function
// This is because of closures.

// So what is a closure?
// A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has returned.
// The child scope always has access to the parent scope, but the parent scope does not have access to the child scope.
// The child scope has access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has returned.

// So in the above example, the booker function has access to the numOfPassengers variable, even after the secureBooking function has returned.

// Let us now look at another example:
let f;

const g = function () {
  const a = 23;
  f = function () {
    console.log(a * 2);
  };
};

const h = function () {
  const b = 777;
  f = function () {
    console.log(b * 2);
  };
};

g();

// Now let us call f:
f(); // Prints: 46

// Now let us reassign f:
h();

// Now let us call f again:
f(); // Prints: 1554

// So what happened here?
// In the first call to f, the value of a was 23.
// In the second call to f, the value of b was 777.
// So the value of a and b were different in the two calls to f.
// But the value of a and b were not stored in the f function.
// So how did f know the value of a and b?
// This is because of closures.
// The f function has access to the parent scope of the g function, even after the g function has returned.
// The f function has access to the parent scope of the h function, even after the h function has returned.

// So in the first call to f, the value of a was 23.
// In the second call to f, the value of b was 777.
// So the value of a and b were different in the two calls to f.
// But the value of a and b were not stored in the f function.
// So how did f know the value of a and b?
// This is because of closures.
// The f function has access to the parent scope of the g function, even after the g function has returned.
// The f function has access to the parent scope of the h function, even after the h function has returned.

// So in the first call to f, the value of a was 23.
// In the second call to f, the value of b was 777.
// So the value of a and b were different in the two calls to f.
// But the value of a and b were not stored in the f function.
// So how did f know the value of a and b?
// This is because of closures.
// The f function has access to the parent scope of the g function, even after the g function has returned.
// The f function has access to the parent scope of the h function, even after the h function has returned.

// Let us now look at another example:

const boardPassengers = function (n, wait) {
  const perGroup = n / 3;

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers.`);
    console.log(`There are 3 groups, each with ${perGroup} passengers.`);
  }, wait * 1000);

  console.log(`Will start boarding in ${wait} seconds.`);
};

const perGroup = 1000;
boardPassengers(180, 3);
// Prints:
// Will start boarding in 3 seconds.
// We are now boarding all 180 passengers.
// There are 3 groups, each with 60 passengers.

// So what happened here?
// The boardPassengers function has a local variable perGroup.
// The boardPassengers function also has a parameter n.
// The boardPassengers function also has a parameter wait.
// The boardPassengers function also has a function inside it.
// The boardPassengers function also has a setTimeout function inside it.
// The boardPassengers function also has a console.log function inside it.

// So the boardPassengers function has access to the perGroup variable, the n parameter, the wait parameter, the function inside it, the setTimeout function inside it and the console.log function inside it.
