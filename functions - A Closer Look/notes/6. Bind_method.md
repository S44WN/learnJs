# The bind method

## - Just like the call and the apply method, the bind method allows us to set the this keyword for any function call.

## - The difference is that, unlike the call and apply methods, bind does not immediately call the function. Instead it returns a NEW function where the this keyword is already bound.

## - This is especially useful when we have to manually assign the this keyword in the case of event listeners. Recall for event listeners the callback function should be a function, and it should not be immediately called. call and apply immediately call the function. Hence we use the bind method instead.

```js
// Just like the 'call' and the 'apply' method, the 'bind' method allows us to set the 'this' keyword for any function call
// The difference is that, unlike the call and apply methods, bind does not immediately call the function.
// Instead, it returns a new function where the 'this' keyword is bound.
const dave = {
  name: "Dave Doe",
  age: 23,
  birthYear: 1988,
  friends: [],

  addFriendAndGender(newFriend, gender) {
    this.friends.push(newFriend);
    console.log(
      `${this.name} made a new friend named ${newFriend} with gender ${gender}`
    );
  },
};

const addAnotherFriend = dave.addFriendAndGender;

const eve = {
  name: "Eve Doe",
  age: 23,
  birthYear: 1988,
  friends: [],
};
// We are using the bind method to set 'this' keyword to eve.
// Note that this will not call the 'addAnotherFriend' function.
// Instead it will return a new function where the 'this' keyword will always be set 'eve'
const addFriendForEve = addAnotherFriend.bind(eve);

// And we can call this function like:
addFriendForEve("Felicia", "female");
// Prints: Eve Doe made a new friend named Felicia with gender female
// We no longer have to specify the 'this' keyword separately now!
// And we can test this:
console.log(eve.friends); // Prints: ["Felicia"]

// Notice how in the 'call' method, apart from the 'this', we could pass in args for the functions.
// We can do the same for 'bind' method as well.
// Now in this case, the name of the friend is fixed as 'Alex'
const addFriendsForEveNamedAlex = addAnotherFriend.bind(eve, "Alex");
// And we call the function as follows, passing ONLY the second args now.
addFriendsForEveNamedAlex("female"); // Prints: Eve Doe made a new friend named Alex with gender female

// This kind of technique where we pre-set a part of the args beforehand is known as 'Partial Application'.

// Using the bind technique with Event Listeners
const lufthansa = {
  airline: "Lufthansa",
  iataCode: "LH",
  bookings: [],
  // book: function() {}
  book(flightNum, name) {
    console.log(
      `${name} booked a seat on ${this.airline} flight ${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`
    );
    this.bookings.push({ flight: `${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`, name });
  },
};

// Add a new property to the lufthansa object called 'planes'. This means that the company currently has 300 planes
lufthansa.planes = 300;
// Whenever you buy a plane, your number of planes is incremented by 1
lufthansa.buyPlane = function () {
  console.log(this);
  this.planes++;
  console.log(this.planes);
};
// So the intention is that whenever a user clicks on the 'Buy Planes' button, the buyPlane method should be called and increment
// the count of planes by 1 and log it to the console.
// But now, when we click on the button, the 'this' keyword logs: <button class="buy">Buy new plane ðŸ›©</button>
// document.querySelector('.buy').addEventListener('click', lufthansa.buyPlane);

// Why does the 'this' keyword log the element, and not the 'lufthansa' object.
// In L96 we read that:
// If the function is called as an event listener, then the 'this' keyword will point to the DOM Element that the handler function is attached to.
// So this is expected behavior.
// In order to get around this problem, we now have to manually assign the 'this' keyword to this function so that we get the intended behavior.
// But which way should we follow? Should we use call, apply, or bind.
// ONLY bind allows us to manually assign the 'this' keyword without immediately calling the function.
// And since this is a callback function, that is what we want to happen
// Hence we use the 'bind' method in this case
// And we replace the above even listener with the following:
document
  .querySelector(".buy")
  .addEventListener("click", lufthansa.buyPlane.bind(lufthansa));
// And now we get the correct behavior
// And we see that the 'this' logs:
// {airline: "Lufthansa", iataCode: "LH", bookings: Array(0), planes: 300, book: Æ’...}
// which is what we intended
```
