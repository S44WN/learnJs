# The call and apply methods

## - We can set the this keyword manually in JS as well.

```js
// Recall how the 'this' keyword worked in the case of simple objects

const alice = {
  name: "Alice Doe",
  age: 21,
  birthYear: 1990,
  friends: [],
  addFriend(newFriend) {
    // The 'this' keyword will point to the object which called this method
    this.friends.push(newFriend);
    console.log(`${this.name} made a new friend named ${newFriend}`);
  },
  addFriendAndAge(newFriend, age) {
    this.friends.push(newFriend);
    console.log(
      `${this.name} made a new friend named ${newFriend} whose age is ${age}`
    );
  },
};

alice.addFriend("Bob Doe");

// Now suppose we wanted to create a new person named Bob.
// Bob would have the same property names as Alice.
// It would also have a addFriend() method.
// But we do not want to duplicate the method again for the Bob object.
const bob = {
  name: "Bob Doe",
  age: 22,
  birthYear: 1989,
  friends: [],
};

// Instead, what we do is we store the method from the alice object in an external variable and then reuse the function
const addNewFriendExt = alice.addFriend;

// Remember, if we tried to call the addNewFriendExt function here, we would have an error because this is an external function
// and like we had seen earlier, for a regular function call, the 'this' keyword is 'undefined'
addNewFriendExt("Alice"); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'friends' of undefined

// So now the question is
// how do we tell JS explicitly which object it should refer to when using the addNewFriendExt() method?
// The requirement is: if we want to add a friend to the alice object, the 'this' keyword should refer to the 'alice' object
// and if we want to add a friend to the bob object, the 'this' keyword should refer to the 'bob' object

// There are 3 options: call, apply, bind

// 1) call

// Recall that functions are objects, and objects have methods.
// Hence we can access the 'call' method on a function
// The first argument in the call method is object that we want the 'this' keyword to point to.
// All the args after the first one are the args of the original function on which we are calling the 'call' method
addNewFriendExt.call(alice, "Charlie Doe");
addNewFriendExt.call(bob, "Dave Doe");

console.log(alice.friends); // Prints: ["Bob Doe", "Charlie Doe"]
console.log(bob.friends); // Prints: ["Dave Doe"]

// Note this method: addNewFriendExt.call(bob, 'Dave Doe');
// So the important point to consider is, even though we had the 'this' keyword inside the 'alice' object,
// we still managed to manually override the 'this' keyword by calling the function using the 'call' method and passing
// in our own 'this' variable

// Similar we can do this for any other object
const charlie = {
  name: "Charlie Doe",
  age: 23,
  birthYear: 1988,
  friends: [],
};
addNewFriendExt.call(charlie, "Alice Doe"); // Prints: Charlie Doe made a new friend named Alice Doe
console.log(charlie.friends); // Prints: ["Alice Doe"]

// 2) apply

// This is similar to the call method we discussed above, except that the args to the function are provided as an array
const addFriendAndAgeExt = alice.addFriendAndAge;

addFriendAndAgeExt.call(charlie, "Bob Doe", 21); // Prints: Charlie Doe made a new friend named Bob Doe whose age is 21

// Using apply, it would be:
addFriendAndAgeExt.apply(charlie, ["Dave Doe", 22]); // Prints: Charlie Doe made a new friend named Dave Doe whose age is 22

// But we avoid using this, as we can do just this:
const friendDetails = ["Eve Doe", 21];
addFriendAndAgeExt.call(charlie, ...friendDetails); // Prints: Charlie Doe made a new friend named Eve Doe whose age is 21
```
