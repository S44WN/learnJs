# How passing arguments works - Value vs. Reference

## - In JS, Primitives are passed by value, and Objects are passed by "copy of a reference".

## - Source on StackOverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13104494/does-javascript-pass-by-reference "Explaination on StackOverflow").

## - So what does this mean?

## - Let's look at the following example:

```js
const flight = "LH234";
const jonas = {
  name: "Jonas Schmedtmann",
  passport: 24739479284,
};

const checkIn = function (flightNum, passenger) {
  // We are changing the flightNum
  flightNum = "LH999";
  // And we are also changing the name of the passenger
  passenger.name = "Mr. " + passenger.name;

  if (passenger.passport === 24739479284) {
    console.log("Checked in");
  } else {
    console.log("Wrong passport!");
  }
};

checkIn(flight, jonas);
// Note that the flight remains unchanged because the value was copied
console.log(flight); // Prints: LH234
// But the name changes, because the 'name' field is within an object, and objects are passed by reference
// (well the value of their reference is copied and passed in by value)
// So JS only has pass-by-value.
// This is in contrast to other languages like C++ where the primitives can also be passed by their reference
console.log(jonas); // Prints: {name: "Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann", passport: 24739479284}
```
