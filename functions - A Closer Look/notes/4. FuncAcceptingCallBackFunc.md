# Functions accepting Callback Functions

## - Higher-Order Function examples and how they are used in JS:

```js
// Two functions that will passed into the higher-order fn as args
const oneWord = function (str) {
  return str.replace(/ /g, "").toLowerCase(); // g is for global and i is for case-insensitive
};

const upperFirstWord = function (str) {
  const [first, ...others] = str.split(" ");
  return [first.toUpperCase(), ...others].join(" ");
};

// This is a higher-order function:
// because it is a functions accepting callback functions
const transformer = function (str, fn) {
  console.log(`Original string: ${str}`);

  // Note how we are calling the function
  const returnedVal = fn(str);
  console.log(`Transformed string: ${returnedVal}`);
  // Transformed string: JAVASCRIPT is the best!
  // Transformed string: javascriptisthebest!

  // Since functions are objects, functions can have methods of their own. Functions can even have properties
  // fn.name is one such property that returns the name of the function
  console.log(`Transformed by: ${fn.name}`);
  // Transformed by: upperFirstWord
  // Transformed by: oneWord
};

// We call the higher-order fn as follows:
transformer("JavaScript is the best!", upperFirstWord);
transformer("JavaScript is the best!", oneWord);

// JS uses callbacks all the time.
const high5 = function () {
  console.log("ðŸ‘‹");
};
// Here, the addEventListener() is just like the transformer() function we wrote above
// and the high5 function is the callback function like the oneWord/upperFirstWord function
// On it's own, the addEventListener would have no idea what do do when a 'click' event occurred.
// It is the callback function that actually executes the required functionality.
// Hence callback functions are described as a means of implementing abstractions. Where addEventListener is more of a
// 'higher-order' (hence the name) of abstraction
// and the high5() method is more of a lower level of abstraction.
document.body.addEventListener("click", high5);
```

# Functions accepting Callback Functions

```js
// Functions Returning Functions
const greet = function (greeting) {
  return function (name) {
    console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
  };
};

// Since 'greet' returns a function, 'greeterhey' is also a function
const greeterHey = greet("Hey");

// And hence we can call 'greeterHey' with args of its own
greeterHey("Alice"); // Prints: Hey Alice
greeterHey("Bob"); // Prints: Hey Bob

// And we can also do something like this.
// greet('Hello') returns a function in which we then pass 'Charlie'
greet("Hello")("Charlie"); // Prints: Hello Charlie

// You can even rewrite the greet() function using just the arrow notation
const greetArrow = (greeting) => (name) => console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);

const greetArrowFn = greetArrow("Hey there");
greetArrowFn("Dave"); // Prints: Hey there Dave
```
